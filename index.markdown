Welcome to my website!

I am Aycan, a computational social scientist specializing in causal inference, machine learning, and natural language processing. My journey over the past decade has been dedicated to unraveling the complexities of human behavior, particularly in how individuals form opinions amidst the dynamic economic shifts driven by globalization. 

My strength lies in analyzing large-scale, diverse datasets and extracting meaningful insights. I amnot only focused on the analytical aspects of data science but also on presenting these complex ideas in a clear and understandable manner. Through teaching economics courses and participating in various conferences, I have honed my ability to communicate complex data science concepts to a wide range of audiences.  

I received my PhD in International Political Economy and Quantitative Research Methods from the University of Virginia. After my doctoral studies, I worked as a research fellow at Princeton and Carnegie Mellon University. To visit my academic webpage, [click here](https://aycankatitas.weebly.com/).

I invite you to explore my portfolio and resume to get a deeper sense of my professional journey and the projects that fuel my passion for data science. If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:ak8ef@virginia.edu) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aycan-gamache/).
