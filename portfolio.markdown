## Causal Inference

### Estimating the Effect of Chinese Trade Inflows on Anti-Trade Ad Campaigns 

Trade emerged as a key issue in the 2016 elections, prominently highlighted by Donald Trump, yet it had already been a significant bipartisan concern prior to 2016. In this project, I have combined more than 10 million records of televised political advertisements, broadcasted from 2000 to 2016, with data on regional economic and demographic indicators. By utilizing an instrumental varaible strategy, I estimated the impact of the surge in Chinese imports on the frequency of trade-related advertising across 210 Nielsen-designated media markets.

### Estimating the Effect of Anti-Trade Ad Campaigns on Public Trade Sentiments

The project examines teh impact of anti-trade advertising on public sentiments towards trade. To estimate the causal effect of these advertisements on public opinion, I employ a two-pronged strategy. First, I utilize a within-subject design and estimate a dynamic panel model, demonstrating that exposure to negative trade advertisements correlates with increasingly negative opinions on trade. Secondly, I apply a spatial regression discontinuity design to illustrate that patterns of regional anti-trade advertising are a driving factor in regional opposition to trade. To assess regional attitudes towards trade, I employ multi-level regression and poststratification on individual survey data.
